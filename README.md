# Predicting-Hazardous-NEOs-Nearest-Earth-Objects-
##Project Description:
In this project, we will work with a real-world dataset that tracks Nearest Earth Objects (NEOs)
observed by NASA from 1910 to 2024. The dataset contains 338,199 records, each representing
an object in space that has been monitored for its proximity to Earth. Some of these objects are
classified by NASA as "is_hazardous," indicating that they pose a potential danger to our planet.
Your task is to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a NEO is
hazardous or not. This is a critical task, as the ability to accurately identify dangerous objects
could be vital for planetary defense.
